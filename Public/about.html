        <h1>My Journey So Far...</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Coding was not always something I was set out to do.</h2> 
            <hr>
            I was recently introduced to it by my long time friend, Marco, who has shown me all kinds of great things you can create with coding and web design!
            Previously, I was looking for anyone who would hire me and I spent years at these jobs not feeling accomplished or as if I had made any real impact on my own life/career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that doesn't mean I didn't work hard or do well at work! I usually did what I could to learn everything and everything in order to become an employee who is reliable and irreplaceable.
            At every job I've had, I have earned postions in which I was trusted with: 
            <ul>
                <li>sensitive information
                    <ul>
                        <li>employee's personal documents such as social security numbers, write ups, birth certificates, etc.</li>
                        <li>customer's credit card information, addresses, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>money (while unsupervised)
                    <ul>
                        <li>this incudes safe access</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>keys that grant access to entire buildings</li>
                <li>time sensitive tasks</li>
                <li>managing entire teams or individuals</li>
                <li>reaching out to external businesses in order to schedue services within the buidling</li>
                <li>placing orders to keep our business running
                    <ul>
                        <li>food, paper goods, cleaning supplies, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>As you can  tell by my partial list of prior responsibilities, I am no stranger to hard work 	(｡•̀ᴗ-)✧</p>
        <p>
            <strong>However</strong>, I am now looking for something to challenge me further. I am someone who enjoys trying to solve issues and figuring out new ways to solve old problems that might make my (or other's) job easier.
            I am someone who enjoys working in teams and having my superiors give me feedback in order to help me grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            I beleive that beginning my coding journey will bring me great opportinites to lead a more fulfilling career and I am more than excited to learn all that I can.
